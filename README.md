Just some random notes in ChucK, sending OSC to Processing for visualizations.
Processing also handles mouse input, sending it back to ChucK; in this way,
bidirectional communication between ChucK and Processing is demonstrated.

Project was written and tested with ChucK 1.2.1.4 (dracula) and Processing
2.0a6 and requires the oscp5 library for Processing, available here:
